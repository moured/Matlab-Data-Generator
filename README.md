## ABOUT
As part of our Digital Signal Processing course, we implemented a MATLAB GUI which can Generate/Aquist data and save it to workspace for furhter processing.
## Implemented Tasks
The GUI can do the follwoing things :
1. Record sound data from a microphone with given sampling rate and bits per second.
1. Load sound data from directory.
1. Generate Time/Frequence domain signals with given charataristics. Supported singlas are:
      * Sinusoidal signal
      * Windowed sinusoidal
      * Rectangle windowed linear chirp
      * Square wave
      * Sawtooth wave
      * Signal involving multiple components
## How To Run
The GUI is coded and tested with MATLAB R2019b.<br>
* First include all project files and folders from Current Folder window. Then right click on <strong>Home.fig</strong> and choose "Open in GUIDE". Finally you can press the play button. 
* The other option to run the GUI is to export it as .exe via MATLAB Compiler.
